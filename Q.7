Write a program in Python using Pandas to perform the following: a. Calculate and display familywise gross monthly income.
MonthlyIncome (Rs.)
44000.00 65000.00 43150.00 66500.00 255000.00 103000.00
55000.00 112400.00 81030.00
b. c. d. e.
Display the highest and lowest monthly income for each family name
Calculate and display monthly income of all members earning income less than Rs. 80000.00. Display total number of females along with their average monthly income
Delete rows with Monthly income less than the average income of all members
